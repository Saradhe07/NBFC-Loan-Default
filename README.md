# NBFC-Loan-Default
A machine learning model to predict loan default risk based on  customer financial and credit features. It uses LightGBM, a powerful gradient boosting  framework, combined with feature engineering, cross-validation, and scaling techniques to  ensure robust and generalizable results.

# Technical Workflow:
1. Library Imports

   • pandas, numpy → data manipulation and numerical operations
   
   • scikit-learn → preprocessing, model evaluation, scaling
   
   • lightgbm → model training (LGBMClassifier)
   
   • StratifiedKFold → maintains class distribution during cross-validation
   
   • StandardScaler → feature normalization
   
2. Data Loading
   • Train_set.csv → contains features and the target column default
   
   • Test_set.csv → used for final prediction and submission

3. Preprocessing
   
   • Target Separation: The default column was extracted as y, and X retained feature columns.
   
   • Missing Value Handling: All missing values were replaced with -999 (a placeholder value).
   
   • Categorical Encoding: Used LabelEncoder for categorical columns to convert them into numeric form.
                           Encoder fitted on combined train + test columns to ensure consistency.
   
4. Feature Engineering

5. Feature Scaling
   
   Applied StandardScaler to normalize numerical columns

6. Model Training — Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation
   
   Model: LightGBM Classifier
   
   Configuration:
   
      • n_estimators=1500
   
      • learning_rate=0.03
   
      • num_leaves=60
   
      • subsample=0.8, colsample_bytree=0.8
   
      • scale_pos_weight → balances the ratio of default/non-default classes
   
      • reg_alpha=0.2, reg_lambda=0.3 → L1/L2 regularization
   
      • min_child_samples=25
   
   Cross-Validation: 5-fold Stratified K-Fold ensures stable accuracy across folds and reduces overfitting risk. And an average accuracy is computed at the end.

7. Prediction and Submission
   
      • Final predictions on test data were generated by averaging the probabilities from all folds.
   
      • A threshold of 0.5 was used to classify defaults
   
   Submission file created: final_submission.csv
   
   Output columns:
   
   • ID 
   • default (0 or 1)
